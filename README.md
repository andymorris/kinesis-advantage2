From user manual:

### 7.3 Power User Mode, “PUM” (progm + Shift + Esc)

Before accessing any of the Power User Tools described below, it its first necessary to activate Power User Mode (PUM) on the keyboard using the onboard shortcut. To do this, press and hold the Program Key and the Shift Key, and then tap the Escape Key. All four LED indicator lights will flash four times to indicate when PUM has been activated, and two times to indicate when it has been deactivated. Note: When PUM is active, a new line on the Status Report will appears to indicate this. When it is inactive, it is not listed in the Status Report. If you attempt to activate one of the features below without having first activated PUM, nothing will happen. Once activated, PUM will stay active until it is manually deactivated or a Hard Reset is performed.

Caution: If you accidentally tap Esc before pressing Shift, you will generate a Status Report.

### 7.4 Opening the “Advantage2” v-drive (progm + F1, PUM Required)

As briefly described in Section 2.2, the Advantage2 contains a virtual flash drive named “Advantage2” where the keyboard’s layout files (e.g., qwerty.txt and dvorak.txt) and firmware files are stored. The Advantage2’s “v-drive” is normally hidden from your computer, and it is not necessary to access the v-drive for basic keyboard usage or any of the onboard programming shortcuts.

There are three reasons to access the v-drive: 1) to use the graphical SmartSet programming app when it becomes available, 2) to perform Direct Editing of a layout file (view the layout, edit existing macros/remaps, or create new macros/remaps), and 3) to perform a firmware update. There are three ways to open (aka “mount”) the v-drive.

Note: Depending on your operating system, it may take up to twelve seconds for the v-drive to appear.

#### Onboard shortcut to open v-drive

If the keyboard is plugged in and Power User Mode is enabled, simply hold the Program Key and tap F1.
